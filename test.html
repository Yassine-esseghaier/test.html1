        <h3>what is the meta-verse?</h3>
        <p>The metaverse is the emerging 3-D-enabled digital space that uses virtual reality, augmented reality, and other advanced internet and semiconductor technology to allow people to have lifelike personal and business experiences online.</p>

<h4>how does it work?</h4>
<p>The metaverse is a version of the internet in which users, in the form of avatars, enter a single, shared environment to experience an immersive, 3D world that features both virtual and augmented reality – encountering the environment and connecting with others in ways they can't in the physical world.</p>

    <h5>what are AR and VR?</h5>
    <p>Simply put, AR, or augmented reality, uses technology to add or augment a person’s view of reality with a computer-generated image. If you’ve tried Pokémon Go on your smartphone or the IKEA furniture placement app, you’ve experienced AR. The game lets players catch characters based on their real locations on a map. It’s physical and virtual all at once.

        Advanced AR headsets—together with new and enabling technologies such as 5G, edge computing, and cloud capable of delivering mega volumes of data—are helping the metaverse deliver a level of virtual digital experience that is more realistic than the online gaming platforms that have been around since the early 2000s (and were the early forebears of the metaverse), where people could create avatars through which they could have semi-lifelike virtual experiences.
        
        Virtual reality (VR), on the other hand, doesn’t include a physical-world component (besides the handset or other equipment such as a helmet or sensor-laden gloves). In VR, users enter a computer-generated simulation but can interact with it in a way that seems real. You might be familiar with videogames that use VR, but the technology is used in a variety of other ways that go beyond recreation.
        
        Here are some examples of how AR and VR can be used:
        
        in immersive ideation for product development
        during design-to-value (DtV) exercises
        in the “creative economy” (art, journalism, music, etcetera) by offering opportunities to create transformative experiences by promoting new feelings, skills, and understanding
        in sports and entertainment (fans might watch 360-degree AR replays, for example)
        in retail for “experience design” (creating a “wow” factor in retail, beyond just shopping)
        Mixed reality, or MR, is a term you might also see. That generally refers to situations that combine elements of both AR and VR. With mixed reality, you can use elements of the real world to interact with a virtual environment. To borrow an example from gaming, if you were playing a mixed-reality game with a headset, you could in theory pick up an item from your desk or coffee table and incorporate it into the game.</p>
